# *Problem 8*. Given a list L = [c1 , ..., cn ] of n distinct characters, 
# write a program which generates a random string s such that every character of s is an element of L and such that character ci occurs i times in s.

n = int(input("Enter value of n: "))

L = [n]

for i in range(1, n):
    input(L[i])

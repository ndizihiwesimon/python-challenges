# *Problem 20*: Each year the School of Computing Science needs to process exam marks for the students in the department. 
# The highest achieving student gets a price and meets the Head of School. The people who fail a course receive a letter with information about what courses they’ve failed. 
# The School needs to report how the class did on average. 
# To progress to Honours students need to pass all courses and get an average of 70. 
# How many satisfy the requirement? Finally,
# each year the Head of School gives a raise to the lecturer of the best performing course. 
# It’s also of interest to know which subject has worst performance. 
# The staff are too busy, so they’ve asked you to write a program that can help them get that information. 
# They’ve helpfully processed it for you, so that all you need is stored in lists.
#
